                    Lifestyle farming, also known as hobby farming or small-scale farming, involves cultivating a small piece of land primarily for personal enjoyment rather than commercial profit. It's a popular endeavor for individuals or families who want to connect with nature, produce their own food, or simply enjoy the therapeutic aspects of working the land.
